- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.5 or above)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (Not required on windows, binary is already in the folder)
- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) /  [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Choose any one of the two)

##### Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/jaysonlong/webvideo-downloader.git
```

##### Project Installation

Install any of the following Violentmonkey/Tampermonkey Scripts. Simply click the link to install:

- [WebVideoDownloader](https://github.com/jaysonlong/webvideo-downloader/raw/master/violentmonkey/WebVideoDownloader.user.js)

- [CommonHlsDownloader](https://github.com/jaysonlong/webvideo-downloader/raw/master/violentmonkey/CommonHlsDownloader.user.js)（Optional. Universal HLS download script, works on **all** websites that use HLS）

First execute the python script：

```
python daemon.py
```

Then visit the video website and click on a video, you will be presented with a pop up download button, click the button to download.
